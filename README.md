Adding words to a wiktionary project
For now this script works only for Moroccan Darija.

## Purpose
This program generates code that can be copy-pasted into a Moroccan Darija Wiktionary. It takes the content of an Excel sheet row by row and generates the code for a single page. If a word has multiple entries, the concatenated code gets added to the same code file.

## Future development
The program was originally made mainly to make the process of adding words faster with minimal coding effort. In the future, it will be further modularized in the next steps to improve maintainability and extensibility, and other functionalities will be added, including reading from Google Sheets, adding a bot that would write the code directly into the wiki, etc.
